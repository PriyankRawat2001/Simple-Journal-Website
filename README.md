# Simple-Blog-MongoDB version

This is an exercise in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/). It's a simple blogging web application where one can **add new blog posts**, **view them** in their own dedicated route, and **delete them**. The posts are stored in a local MongoDB database. [EJS templating](https://ejs.co/) is used for the HTML pages, [Bootstrap v4.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) is also used, along with some custom CSS styling.  
It's basically a backend database upgrade of [this application](https://github.com/dimitristsaknakis/simple-blog-website).
